# playo

- This is a JavaFX based application that mimics the use of the playo application (a popular android based application for sport courts booking)
- This is not similar to the andriod application in any manner except the fact that both of them share the common goal of getting court owners to rent out their courts to interested players and ofcourse the name of the application
- This was just done as a part of curriculum project for the Java course in college and has no other commercial use as such
- This uses the MySQL server hosted on localhost though changes can be made to the database uri to access a remote database
- Please ensure that you have JavaFX installed in your JDK
- IntelliJ Idea was used for this so it is recommended to use that to run this code
- Use the table.sql file to make the required schema in the MySQL server
